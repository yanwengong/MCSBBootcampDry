# Basics of scripting
### Script vs function vs command window
## Path file
## Google is your friend

## Commenting

## Variables

### Protected variable names, intelligent variable names, etc
### pi, i


## If-statements

'If' statements are conditional: that is, they create a block of code that only executes if it passes some condition.


#### Else

#### Many cases: Switch

## For-loops

## While-loops

### Initial example: Infinite loop
### Ctrl-C
### Safety checks

## Vectors

## Vector math

- Matlab specific
- dot notation (.^, .*, ./)


## Plotting

- Always plotting vectors, not expressions (e.g. x.^2 is squared version of vector 'x', NOT x^2 where x is any and all numbers)
Some useful options:

- hold on: allows you to plot multiple thing on same axes
- 'LineStyle'
- 'LineWidth'
- 'Color'
xlabel()
xlim()

## Save, Load
save('filename','variables')
load('filename','variables')

## Debugging tips

- Print everything
- Run section
- Add breakpoints
- SIMPLIFY SIMPLIFY SIMPLIFY <- Better to start here when coding too
- Run and time - see what parts are taking forever
